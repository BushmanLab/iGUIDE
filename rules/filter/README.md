# Sequence Filtering Rules
After nucleotide sequences have been trimmed and selected for based on contained sequence information individually for paired-end reads, the pairs of reads should be compared to filter for only reads which contain both an R1 and R2 sequence read. 

This directory contains the rules for filtering R1 and R2 sequence files.
