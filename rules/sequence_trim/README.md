# Sequence Trimming Rules
When DNA is sequenced, it typically contains target or synthetic sequences. These sequences can disrupt the alignment to the reference genome, giving false data. 

Reads are trimmed for leading and overreading sequences, given the data provided in sample manifests or sample info files.
