Description
===========

Software pipeline for processing and analyzing double-strand DNA break events. 
These events may be induced, such as by designer nucleases like Cas9, or 
spontaneous, as produced through DNA replication or ionizing radiation. A 
laboratory bench-side protocol accompanies this software pipeline, and can be 
found XXX. 

Below, this readme gives the reader a overview of the pipeline, including how 
to install and process a sample dataset. Processing a sample data set is broken 
into three parts: 

1. developing a configuration file and sample information
2. setting up a run directory and acquiring the sequence data
3. initializing the pipeline and understanding the output
