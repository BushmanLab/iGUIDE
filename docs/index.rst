Description
===========

Software pipeline for processing and analyzing double-strand DNA break events. 
These events may be induced, such as by designer nucleases like Cas9, or 
spontaneous, as produced through DNA replication or ionizing radiation. A 
laboratory bench-side protocol accompanies this software pipeline, and can be 
found (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1625-3). 

This documentation gives the reader an overview of the pipeline, including
how to install and process a sample dataset. Processing a sample data set is 
broken into a few parts: 

#. Developing a configuration file and sample information
#. Setting up a run directory and acquiring the sequence data
#. Initializing the pipeline and understanding the output
